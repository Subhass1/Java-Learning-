 🔴JDK:- JDK stands for java development kit, it internally contains JRE and JVM where JRE stands for java runtime environment 
         & JVM stands for java virtual machine. JDK provides all the tools to work with java language.

 🔴 JRE:- JRE stands for java runtime environment to execute the java program. 
          It internally contains JVM which is responsible to execute a java program. 
          
 🔴 JVM:- JVM stands for java vortual machine. It is the software in the form of interpreter 
          which has written in c language through which we execute our java program.

  ●Java is a totally computer based programming language developed by sun microsystem (James Gosling, Mike sheridan and patricknaughton).
  ● In the year 1991 James Gosling and his friends start a project.  
              Team ⇒ Green Team

 ● James Gosling —————→ green talk 
    Extension —————→ .gt

 ● green talk name changed to oak. Oak changed to i) National tree (U.S.A, france etc) ii) oak technology
  
 ● Oak —————→ java (1995)
 ● Java developed for sethbox, television, remote etc
 ● java become popular on internet programming 
 ● Version —————→ JDK alpha and Beta 1995 (Bought By sun microsystem)
 ● latest version : ...JDK
 ● Sun microsystem —————→ sold to oracle corporation, 2010
