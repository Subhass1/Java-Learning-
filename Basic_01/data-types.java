    ✍️ Definition: Datatype specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variables.


👉 Data types are divided into two groups:
         ● Primitive data types are ⤵️ 
                      //\\
                     //   \\
                    //     \\
                   //        \\
                  //           \\
                 //               \\
             Numeric             Non-numeric
                                   ● Char (2 byte)
                                   ● Boolean (1 bit) True or False
                //
               // \\
              //   \\
             //     \\
            //       \\
        Integric     Decimal
 ● Byte (1 byte)      ● Float (4 byte)    
 ● Short (2 byte)     ● Double (8 byte)
 ● int (2 byte)
 ● Long (8 byte)

         boolean ‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗‗ 1 bit
 



        🔴 Non-primitive data types ⤵️
              ● String
              ● Arrays 
              ● Classes
              ● Interface

    ⇶ Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

    👉The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
            ⇉ Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
            ⇉ Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
            ⇉ A primitive type always has a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
            ⇉ A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
