👉Data types are divided into two groups:
         ● Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
         ● Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes 

         Datatypes                      Size
         byte ========================> 1 byte
         short =======================> 2 bytes
         long ========================> 8 bytes
         int =========================> 4 bytes 
         char ========================> 2 byte
         float =======================> 4 bytes
         double ======================> 8 bytes
         boolean =====================> 1 bit

         👉Non-Primitive Data Types
         ● Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

         ● The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

         ● Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
         ● Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
         ● A primitive type always has a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
         ● A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
