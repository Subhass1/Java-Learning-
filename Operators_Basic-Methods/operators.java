🔴Java divides the operators into the following groups:
            ● Arithmetic operators
            ● Assignment operators
            ● Comparison operators
            ● Logical operators
            ● Bitwise operators

//           👉Arithmetic Operators
/*
  Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator  Name	                    Description	                          Example	
+ 	      Addition	            Adds together two values	               x + y	
-	      Subtraction	        Subtracts one value from another	       x - y	
*	      Multiplication	    Multiplies two values	                   x * y	
/	      Division	            Divides one value by another	           x / y	
%	      Modulus	            Returns the division remainder	           x % y	
++     	  Increment	            Increases the value of a variable by 1	   ++x	
--	      Decrement	            Decreases the value of a variable by 1	   --x

//     👉Java Assignment Operators
/*  The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Operator	Example	       Same As	
=	        x = 5	       x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	       x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	       x = x - 3	
*=	        x *= 3	       x = x * 3	
/=	        x /= 3	       x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	       x = x % 3	
&=	        x &= 3	       x = x & 3	
|=	        x |= 3	       x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	       x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	       x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	       x = x << 3

 // 👉Java Comparison Operators
 /* Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
     Operator	Name	                      Example	
    ==	        Equal to	                   x == y	
    !=	        Not equal	                   x != y	
    >	        Greater than	               x > y	
    <	        Less than	                   x < y	
    >=	        Greater than or equal to	   x >= y	
    <=	        Less than or equal to	       x <= y
  */





  //  👉Java Logical Operators
  /* 🔴Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
  Operator	  Name	           Description	                                              Example
   && 	    Logical and     Returns true if both statements are true	                  x < 5 &&  x < 10	
   || 	    Logical or	    Returns true if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 || x < 4	
   !	    Logical not	    Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	      !(x < 5 && x < 10)
